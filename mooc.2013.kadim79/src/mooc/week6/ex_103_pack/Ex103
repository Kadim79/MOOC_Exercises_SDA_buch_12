Exercise 103: Birdwatchers database

Note1: Your program should use only one Scanner object, i.e., it is allowed to call new Scanner only once.

Note2: Do not save anything in static variables. The main method is executed by the tests multiple times so the use of static variables might cause problems.

This assignment corresponds to three assignment points.

In this assignment you are supposed to design and implement an observation database for a bird watcher. The database contains birds, each of which have a name and a Latin name, both Strings. Database also tracks how many times each bird has been observed.

The program should implement the following commands:

Add - adds a bird
Observation - adds an observation
Statistics - prints all the birds
Show - prints one bird
Quit - terminates the program
The program should also handle the invalid inputs (see Turing below).

The following is an example how the program is supposed to work:

? Add
Name: Raven
Latin Name: Corvus Corvus
? Add
Name: Seagull
Latin Name: Dorkus Dorkus
? Observation
What was observed:? Seagull
? Observation
What was observed:? Turing
Is not a bird!
? Observation
What was observed:? Seagull
? Statistics
Seagull (Dorkus Dorkus): 2 observations
Raven (Corvus Corvus): 0 observations
? Show
What? Seagull
Seagull (Dorkus Dorkus): 2 observations
? Quit

Note you may structure your program freely, it is only required that the output of the program is as in the above example.
