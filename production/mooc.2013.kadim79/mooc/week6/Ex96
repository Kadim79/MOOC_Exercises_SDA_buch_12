Exercise 96: Sum of the array

Implement the method public static sum(int[] array), which returns the sum of the numbers in
the array given as parameter.

Program skeleton:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = {5, 1, 3, 4, 2};
        System.out.println(sum(array));
    }

    public static int sum(int[] array) {
        // write code here
        return 0;
    }
}

The output should be:

15

NOTE: in this and some of the following assignments methods are static as the they used to
be in the assignments for weeks 2 and 3. The reason for this is that the methods are not instance
methods, i.e. not operating with instance variables of objects, instead they are working at
"class level" and operating just with the values and objects given as parameter. In chapter 31
we'll elaborate more on the question whether a method should be static or not.
