Exercise 102: Grade distribution

This assignment corresponds to three assignment points.

Note1: Your program should use only one Scanner object, i.e., it is allowed to call
new Scanner only once. If you need scanner in multiple places, you can pass it as parameter:

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    // ...

    doSomething(scanner);
}

public static void doSomething(Scanner scanner) {
    String riw = scanner.nextLine();
    // ...
}

If another object needs a scanner, you can pass it as constructor parameter and save in
instance variable.

Note2: Do not save anything in static variables. The main method is executed by the tests
multiple times so the use of static variables might cause problems.

The input of the program is a set of exam scores of a course. Each score is an integer.
When -1 is entered, the program stops asking for further input.

Inputting the exam scores should work as follows:

Type exam scores, -1 completes:
34
41
53
36
55
27
43
40
-1

After the scores have been read, the program prints the grade distribution and acceptance
percentage of the course in the following form:

Grade distribution:
5: **
4:
3: ***
2: *
1: *
0: *
Acceptance percentage: 87.5

Grade distribution is formed as follows:

Each exam score is mapped to a grade using the same formula as in exercise 18. If the score
is not within the range 0-60 it is not taken into account.
The number of grades are printed as stars, e.g. if there are 2 scores that correspond to
grade 5, the line 5: ** is printed. If there are no scores that correspond to a particular
grade, as is the case with grade 4 in the above example, the printed line is 4:
All the grades besides zeros are accepted, so in the above 7 out of 8 participants
were accepted. Acceptance percentage is calculated with the formula 100*accepted/allScores.
